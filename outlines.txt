CODE update

working with combo box to order the items in it
in addition to that, relate the content of combo box to own column in same table
((((Recursive Relationship))))

in adding order, show the package price when i choose a package
IDEA: check box to add 500 LE for orders outside Mansoura.


add edit search done

employee wrong with join date format in mysql


**button title under icon

**intro animation

upcoming error
    *combo boxes work with currentindex parameter, which is always [1,2,3,4,5,...]
     unlike MySQL database where 'id' data is not always this way.
    *the problem will appear when i call an index from the combo box and it's deleted
     from the database.

    sol=> work with package name instead and make it primary key
          delete id (will be useless here)
          call and store the data with name of the package(and also with photographers)
